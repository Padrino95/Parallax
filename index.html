                <h2>THE AIRCRAFT</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="texto">
                <p>The aircraft, a Douglas R4D-8, a Super DC-3, was originally in possession of the US Navy and
                    considered to be a symbol of the golden age of air travel.

                    Originally utilised as a cargo aircraft, the US Navy was routinely flying over Iceland during the
                    1970s as a part of its unilateral defence agreement with the country. Iceland is a NATO member, and
                    US forces had a permanent base on the island until 2005.

                    The aircraft crashed into Sólheimasandur on Wednesday, November 21st, 1973, at around 14:00 as
                    reported by the Aviation Safety Network. It was flying from Höfn in Iceland's east coast and onboard
                    were seven crew members.

                    No one is quite sure why the plane crashed, with several theories flying about. Some blame it on ice
                    damaging the plane’s structure; others say that the thrusters were not working correctly. Some say
                    that it was a mishap of the pilot who believed the thrusters were not working when they were.

                    Regardless, it little matters as no one was injured in the crash. The forced landing was made on an
                    icy river by the coast, and though the ice broke, the plane didn't sink.

                    In the years since its rocky landing, the DC Plane Wreck has borne the brunt of Iceland’s
                    tempestuous weather; heavy rainfall, freezing and powerful gales. Today, the aircraft’s wings are no
                    longer attached, and it has only half a tail (rumours stipulate that a local farmer cashed in on the
                    tail long ago.)

                    It is not expected that the plane wreck will be there forever. Sólheimasandur is a glacial outwash
                    plain, meaning when there is an eruption underneath the glacier Mýrdalsjökull, there is a chance
                    floodwater could wash it away.

                    It truly is a case of ‘when there is an eruption’, not if, as Mýrdalsjökull covers Katla, one of the
                    country’s most explosive and regular volcanoes.</p>

                <h2>CASA ABANDONADA BELGICA</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="texto">
                <p>Masion Francine is located in a small village in Belgium. The house was likely built in the 1950s,
                    judging by the architectural style. However, now the house is abandoned. From the paperwork inside
                    the house I estimate for round 10 years. We visited this location during the Belgium 2018 Easter
                    Chateau Tour.

                    MAISON FRANCINE – WHO IS/WAS FRANCINE?
                    Unfortunately, very little information is available about Masion Francine. One name lingers, and
                    echoes here; Francine. Who was Francine? The name is just as likely that of the first explorer who
                    discovered it, or perhaps it was the name of the last resident. At this time, this is lost to the
                    years and remains a mystery

                    The house has another, very fitting, codename; Mold House II. Mold plagues the house, black and
                    sticky. The dark and humid house is seemingly a perfect petri dish for the black mold. Perhaps this
                    is why much of the furniture, books and CDs remain.

                    INSIDE THE DAMP AND DARK MOLD HOUSE II
                    Most of the photogenic rooms inside Masion Francine were downstairs. Firstly, I explore the living
                    room. The living room is long, with a brick archway dividing the room in two. There is a small table
                    and several chairs in here. A detached chandelier sits on the table, covered in dust after years of
                    neglect. The beige wallpaper is very patchy, with large patches of black mold. On first glance, the
                    black appeared to be part of the wallpaper pattern it was that prominent.

                    On the other side of the house is the dining room. This room has some interesting sagging
                    bookshelves. The shelves are buckling under the weight of CDs, books, and records.

                    Lastly I enter a small office. Inside is a wonderful wooden desk and glass-fronted wardrobes. On the
                    desk there are documents, and a pair of glasses. Behind the desk is a cabinet, upon which stands a
                    cute vintage radio.</p>

            <div class="texto">
                <p>Evitar otra catástrofe era la principal preocupación de Valeriy Semenov cuando las tropas rusas
                    entraron con sus tanques en Chernóbil, escenario del peor desastre nuclear de la Historia. Él y
                    decenas de empleados permanecieron trabajando durante los 35 días de ocupación, en los que la
                    actividad de los soldados invasores provocó un aumento de los niveles de radioactividad.

                    Tanques, camiones blindados y decenas de militares rusos se apostaron en la zona de exclusión el
                    pasado 24 de febrero y tomaron la central, algo que vendría sucedido por el despliegue de más de mil
                    soldados que cometieron todo tipo de imprudencias en una de las áreas con más nivel de
                    radioactividad del planeta.
                    Pero Semenov, el ingeniero encargado de la seguridad y el mantenimiento en la planta nuclear,
                    decidió seguir con su labor a pesar de las amenazas que recibió de los rusos durante los 35 días de
                    ocupación, en los que tuvo que realizar turnos de casi 24 horas diarias para garantizar que no
                    hubiera fugas radioactivas que desataran otro desastre como el que sucedió en 1986.

                    “No estamos hablando solamente de la seguridad de esta ciudad, sino de la de toda Ucrania. Cualquier
                    cosa que le pasara a Chernóbil iba a afectar al resto del país”, aseguró este ingeniero en una
                    entrevista con Efe.

                    SOLDADOS UCRANIANOS QUE PROTEGÍAN LA CENTRAL ENTREGARON LAS ARMAS PARA EVITAR DISPAROS. Cuando las
                    tropas rusas entraron en Chernóbil, los 177 soldados ucranianos que custodiaban la zona entregaron
                    las armas por dos razones, según Semenov: porque los invasores tenían más armamento y porque
                    disparar dentro de la central es, literalmente, jugar con fuego.</p>
